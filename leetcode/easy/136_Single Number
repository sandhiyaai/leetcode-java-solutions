136. Single Number

Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Bit Manipulation, Array
Runtime Requirement: O(n)
Space Requirement: O(1)

Problem Statement

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one.
Find that single one.

Examples
Input:  nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Input:  nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Input:  nums = [1]
Output: 1

Approach (Bit Manipulation – XOR)

We use the XOR (^) operation:

a ^ a = 0

XOR is commutative and associative

So when we XOR all elements:

All numbers that appear twice cancel out

The number that appears once remains

Java Solution:
public class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            result ^= num;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
